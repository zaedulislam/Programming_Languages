There are N lines, each lines always start with character '0' followed by '.', then unknown
number of digits x, finally the line always terminated by three dots "...".

N
0.xxxx...

The fastest way to do it is:

#include <stdio.h>
char digits[100];


void main() {
scanf("%d",&N);
for (i=0; i<N; i++)  {
       scanf("0.%[0-9]...",&digits); // surprised?
       printf("the digits are 0.%s\n",digits);
     }
}


Advanced use of printf() and scanf()

Those who have forgotten the advanced use of printf() and scanf(), recall the following
examples:

scanf("%[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]",&line); //line is a string

This scanf() function takes only uppercase letters as input to line and any other characters
other than A..Z terminates the string. Similarly the following scanf() will behave like
gets():

scanf("%[^\n]",line); //line is a string

scanf() and printf(). This will help you in the long run.
